This is a piece of music that I started composing on 10 August 2014. There's a nice melody in a simple 24-bar ABA form (with a modulation to the relative minor 
in the middle), chords in standard jazz notation, and lyrics (all typeset using the wonderful Lilypond - check it out). The lyrics are an adaptation of Percy 
Bysshe Shelley's 'Ozymandias' while the melody was improvised on top of the standard circle progression.
