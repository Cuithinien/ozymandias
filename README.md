ozymandias
==========

This is a piece of music that I started composing on 10 August 2014. There's a nice melody in a simple 24-bar ABA form (with a modulation to the relative minor in the middle), chords in standard jazz notation, and lyrics (all typeset using the wonderful [Lilypond](http://www.lilypond.org/) - check it out). The lyrics are an adaptation of Percy Bysshe Shelley's [*Ozymandias*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias) while the melody was improvised on top of the standard [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%E2%80%93ii%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93I) [progression](http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/56).
